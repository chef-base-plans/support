# Support

This is the Support Repo for Chef Habitat Base Plan Organisation - used to gather global issues that aren't for any particular plan. In the case of individual plans, please search at the [Org top level](https://github.com/chef-base-plans) and raise the issue or PR against the particular plan.


## Habitat Base Plans

Participation in the Habitat community is governed by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

You can browse all available packages that you can leverage and use, including packages built and maintained by community members both inside and outside of this core origin, in [Habitat Builder](https://bldr.habitat.sh/#/explore).

## Contributing

Any plans living in this Github Org tend to be central to the operation of the ecosystem itself, a dependency of a critical plan or else connected in such a way that it makes logical sense to include it outside of the [Core Plans Location](https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plans)

Community and more generally usable plans all live in [habitat-sh/core-plans](https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plans) Github Repository

The code for the core components of Habitat itself is in the [habitat-sh/habitat](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/) GitHub repository.

**NOTE:** instructions are included [here] on how to get started checking out, building, and inspec testing the base plans [here](examples/chef_base_plans_parent/README.md)

## Documentation

Get started with the [Habitat tutorials](https://www.habitat.sh/tutorials/) or plunge into the [complete documentation](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/).

## Design Proposals

As per the Chef OSS Guidelines - [Design Proposals](https://github.com/chef/chef-oss-practices/blob/master/contributors/guide/design-proposals.md) should follow this guidance
